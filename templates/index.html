              Well to put it blunt, it's to make the user able to keep track of time.
              A better overview to see how much the individual has worked as a form of a check-in and check-out system.
              Furthermore, making it easier for people who have a hard time reading or writing to simply tap a button and the app does the work for them.

              With the help of our companion app, the system registers the user's daily work hours.
              It also registers how long certain machinery has been used with the help of our BLE beacons that connect to the phone and send the data to the administrator's dashboard.

              As mentioned before, our system does the heavy lifting â€” storing, sorting, and tracking all the time that employees and machinery have spent.
              This data is kept safe and secure for the administrator only.

              As the high and mighty Administrator, you get your own Dashboard with easy access to all of your employees' work hours and machinery usage.
              You'll have a full overview of everything and everyone.
